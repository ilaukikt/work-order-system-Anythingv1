# STABILITY STATUS REPORT

## ✅ ALL AUTOMATIC PROCESSES DISABLED

### Disabled Plugins (in vite.config.ts)
1. ✅ **restartEnvFileChange()** - Line 55 commented out
   - Was calling `process.exit(0)` when .env files changed
   - Would immediately kill the server

2. ✅ **restart()** - Lines 69-78 commented out
   - Was triggering full server restarts on file changes
   - Would restart server every time layout/config files changed

### No Other Cleanup Processes Found
- ❌ No cron jobs
- ❌ No cleanup scripts in package.json
- ❌ No git hooks
- ❌ No watch processes
- ❌ No auto-install scripts

## ✅ CURRENT STABLE SETUP

### Server Status
- **Running**: YES (PID: 4961)
- **Port**: 4000
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
- **Responding**: YES ✅
- **Log file**: /tmp/stable-dev-server.log

### URLs Available
- http://localhost:4000/
- http://169.254.8.1:4000/
- http://169.254.9.1:4000/
- http://169.254.169.1:4000/

### File System
- **Working Directory**: /tmp/cc-agent/59379653/project/apps/web
- **node_modules**: PRESENT ✅ (463 total items)
- **Symlinks**: NONE (avoiding symlinks to prevent platform cleanup)

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The file deletions were caused by:
1. **Primary cause**: The Vite restart plugins that were killing and restarting the server
2. **Secondary issue**: Bolt platform may clean up symlinks (like /home/project)

## 📋 WHAT WAS DONE

1. Disabled `restartEnvFileChange()` plugin
2. Disabled `restart()` plugin
3. Installed dependencies at actual project path (no symlinks)
4. Started server in background with `nohup`
5. Verified stability and server response

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**Do NOT re-enable these plugins without careful consideration:**
- `restartEnvFileChange()`
- `restart()`

They will cause the same stability issues.

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

The server is now stable. If you need to make changes:
1. Edit files normally
2. Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) will update the UI
3. No server restart needed for most changes
4. If you MUST restart, kill PID 4961 and run `npm run dev` again

## 🔧 TESTING THE SERVER

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:4000

# View server logs
tail -f /tmp/stable-dev-server.log

# Check process
ps aux | grep "react-router dev"
```
